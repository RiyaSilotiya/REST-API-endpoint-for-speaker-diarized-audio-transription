This Django project provides a REST API that processes audio files, performs speaker diarization and transcription, and returns the results in a structured JSON format. The project integrates speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques to deliver accurate transcriptions tagged with speaker identities and timestamps.

REST API: The API accepts audio files as input and returns results in JSON format.
Postman Testing: The API is tested and can be easily interacted with using Postman.
